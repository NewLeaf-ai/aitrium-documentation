## Overview

Atlas is Aitrium's powerful analysis platform that enables you to run comprehensive radiation therapy quality assurance directly from your desktop. With Open Access, you can analyze patient data, create scorecards, and generate reports using your own analysis projects.

## Quick Start Guide

Getting started with Atlas involves three main steps: downloading the desktop application, configuring your analysis project, and running your first analysis.

### Step 1: Download AitriumOS Desktop

Before you begin, you'll need to download and install the AitriumOS desktop application.
