The Trials interface provides a step-by-step experience for managing trial data:

1. **Trial Dataset Validation**: 
   - Verify present patient data
   - Check for missing or invalid data
   - Validate DICOM headers against trial requirements

2. **Structure Standardization** (if applicable):
   - Process and standardize RTSTRUCT organ and target labels
   - Ensure adherence to trial requirements

3. **DICOM Metadata Validation + De-identification**:
   - Analyze DICOM headers
   - Identify potential privacy breaches
   - Enforce de-identification policies

4. **Final Review**:
   - Review all standardized and anonymized data

5. **Upload**:
   - Send the standardized and anonymized data to the trial organization.

You can review submission status for each Patient ID from the trial homepage.
