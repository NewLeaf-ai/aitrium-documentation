## Integrations Module

The **Integrations Module** offers secure ways to transfer your processed medical imagery data to external trial systems or cloud repositories.

### Available Integrations

Depending on your organization's setup and the trial's requirements, you may see one or more of the following:
- **FTP / SFTP**: Secure file transfers over the internet.
- **WebDAV**: For managing and collaborating on files remotely.
- **Local Network Folders**: Send or sync data within your internal file systems.

### Setting Up an Integration

1. **Navigate** to the **Integrations** module.
2. **Add a new integration** by selecting the protocol type (e.g., SFTP).
3. **Enter configuration** details: Host, Port, Authentication method (key-based or password), and any advanced settings required.
4. **Test Connection** to ensure credentials and network paths are correct.

### Transferring Data

Once set up:
1. **Select** your integration from the list.
2. **Choose** the files or folders you want to upload.
3. **Monitor** the transfer progress and logs. If there are any failures, you can retry or check the logs for details.

<Info>
  All integration traffic is encrypted, and you can review your activity logs under **Logs** in the sidebar.
