## Trials Module

The **Trials Module** in the NewLeaf Native Application allows you to view, filter, and manage clinical trials that your site is actively participating in. You can see high-level metadata about each trial, including:

- **Trial Name** and **Description**
- **Enrollment Status**
- **Data Contribution Requirements**

### Viewing Trial Details

From the **Trials** menu option:
1. Select a trial to see its detailed view.
2. Review the trial's aims, phases, and any specific imaging requirements.

### Searching and Filtering

Use the search bar and filters to quickly locate specific trials based on:
- **Keywords**: Filter by a portion of the trial's name or description.
- **Status**: Show only active or closed trials.
- **Enrollment**: Filter by trials that are open for enrollment or completed.

### Data Contribution

When you click into a specific trial, you'll also see any data contribution requirements:
- **Accepted File Types**: E.g., DICOM images.
- **Anonymization Requirements**: A quick link to the Data Tools module to run anonymization prior to upload.
- **Deadline Dates**: Track important submission dates.

<Info>
  For more information on anonymizing and uploading data, check out the [Data Tools](/newleaf-native/data-tools) and [Integrations](/newleaf-native/integrations) sections.
