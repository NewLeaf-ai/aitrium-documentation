## Data Tools Module

The **Data Tools Module** provides local data processing functionality to ensure your medical images meet trial requirements before they’re uploaded. This includes anonymization, validation, and format standardization.

### Anonymization

Many clinical trials require patient-identifying information to be removed or masked:
1. **Select** the folder or file you want to anonymize.
2. **Configure** the anonymization fields (e.g., patient ID, patient name).
3. **Run** the process. A summary report will detail what was removed or replaced.

### Validation

Each clinical trial can have its own schema or standard:
1. **Choose** the trial you plan to contribute data to.
2. **Select** the data to validate.
3. **Run** validation, and review any errors or warnings. This will help ensure data is accepted by the trial’s repository.

### Format Standardization

Convert your data into the required format for the trial:
- **DICOM** or other imaging formats
- **Compression** or decompression if the trial requests a specific format
- **Metadata** updates to comply with trial-specific fields

<Warning>
  Always validate data after anonymization to ensure the new files meet the trial’s requirements.
