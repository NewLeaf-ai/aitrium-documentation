## Overview

Welcome to NewLeaf. We developed the Provider App to streamline trial participation for contributors by making it easier to standardize, validate, and upload data to investigators.

This document is intended to guide first-time users of the Provider App through the initial set-up and installation.

The Trials interface provides a step-by-step experience for managing trial data:

1. **Trial Dataset Validation**: 
   - Verify present patient data
   - Check for missing or invalid data
   - Validate DICOM headers against trial requirements

2. **Structure Standardization** (if applicable):
   - Process and standardize RTSTRUCT organ and target labels
   - Ensure adherence to trial requirements

3. **DICOM Metadata Validation + De-identification**:
   - Analyze DICOM headers
   - Identify potential privacy breaches
   - Enforce de-identification policies

4. **Final Review**:
   - Review all standardized and anonymized data

5. **Upload**:
   - Send the standardized and anonymized data to the trial organization.

You can review submission status for each Patient ID from the trial homepage.

#### Data Tools

The Data Tools module provides core functionality for independent use, including:
- Data anonymization
- Format validation
- Standardization tools
