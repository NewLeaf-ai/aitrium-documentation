# Trial Accelerator Overview

Trial Accelerator enables you to create and manage protocol-driven clinical trials with automated configuration and streamlined site deployment. This platform is ideal for trials with structured protocols and well-defined data requirements.

## What is a Protocol-Driven Trial?

The Advanced Trial Creation workflow minimizes manual setup by:

- **Automatically extracting study configurations** from protocol documents
- **Digitizing study arms and regimens** with dose and fractionation schedules
- **Configuring downstream data workflows** for designated hospital sites
- **Automating site-level experiences** including curated regimens and data collection schedules

## Key Features

### Automated Protocol Ingestion
Upload trial protocols in PDF format and let the system extract:
- Study arms and treatment regimens
- Dose and fractionation schedules
- Inclusion/exclusion criteria (informational)
- Submission event timelines

### Site Management
- Enroll multiple hospital sites from the Aitrium Network
- Assign designated users with upload permissions
- Deploy trial configurations automatically to all sites

### Data Collection
- Configure custom data collection schedules
- Set timing windows and anchor dates for submissions
- Define patient-level and site-level events

### Quality Assurance
- Apply DICOM de-identification policies
- Configure data transfer integrations (SFTP)
- Monitor trial progress across all sites

## Getting Started

To create your first protocol-driven trial, follow the [Creating Protocol-Driven Trials](/trial-accelerator/creating-protocol-trials) guide, which walks through the complete setup process from trial creation to site deployment.

For advanced features like dose constraints and benchmark cases, see [Advanced Configuration](/trial-accelerator/advanced-configuration).
