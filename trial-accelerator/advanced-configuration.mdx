# Advanced Trial Configuration

Once a protocol-driven trial is live, you have a suite of configuration tools to refine the setup. These features let you tailor arms/regimens, enforce dose constraints, shape the data collection timeline, and set up site-events for ongoing quality and compliance.

---

## 1. Manually Create or Edit Study Arms & Regimens

You can fine-tune the treatment structure of your trial beyond automatic extraction:

- Use the **Arms & Regimens editor** to add new arms (e.g., "Adaptive", "Hypofractionated") or deactivate existing ones
- Define each regimen's dose, fractionation, and modality (e.g., 60 Gy in 30 fx, IMRT)
- Reassign patients to updated arms when needed
- All changes are logged and version-controlled

### Key Features
- Add unlimited study arms to accommodate trial complexity
- Configure treatment parameters specific to each arm
- Maintain audit trail of all modifications
- Update active trials without disrupting ongoing data collection

## 2. Add Dose Constraints to Treatment Regimens

Each regimen can have one or more ROI-specific dose constraints:

### Example Constraints
- **Spinal Cord**: Dmax < 45 Gy
- **Heart**: V20Gy < 10%
- **Lung**: Mean < 12 Gy

### Constraint Types
- **Hard constraints**: Must-pass requirements that block submission if violated
- **Soft constraints**: Advisory warnings that flag potential issues

Constraints are used in QA review and scorecard generation to ensure protocol compliance across all participating sites.

---

## 3. Advanced Data Collection Schedules

The schedule of expected data submissions can be customized beyond the protocol-extracted defaults:

### Customization Options
- **Add/edit events** such as "Week 3 Mid-Tx" or "Follow-up Month 6"
- **Specify required file types** (e.g., CT, RTSTRUCT, MRI, RTDOSE)
- **Configure timing logic** (e.g., every 3 months, ±5 days)
- **Apply globally or to specific arms** for arm-specific data requirements

### Event Types
- **Patient-level events**: Tied to individual patient timelines (treatment start, follow-ups)
- **Site-level events**: Apply to the entire site (training, credentialing, audits)

---

## 4. Configure Site-Level Events

To enforce standards and facilitate site onboarding:

### Site-Level Events
Configure critical milestones for each participating site:

- **Investigator training windows**: Schedule and track required training sessions
- **Credentialing deadlines**: Ensure sites meet qualification requirements
- **Interim QA audits**: Schedule periodic quality assessments

These events appear on the trial dashboard for each site, providing visibility into trial readiness and ongoing compliance.

---

## Best Practices

### Version Control
- Always review draft versions before publishing.  Onced published, the changes to your protocol will automatically take affect.
- Review the version history to track trial evolution

### Testing
- Test data collection schedules with sample submissions
- Verify dose constraints with representative treatment plans
