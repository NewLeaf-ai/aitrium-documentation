## Overview

The Integrations page allows organization administrators to manage data transfer integrations, credentials, and user permissions. This guide will help you understand how to configure and manage integrations for your organization.

---

## Accessing Your Integrations

1. Navigate to **Dashboard** > **Integrations** from the main menu
2. You'll see a list of all integrations configured for your organization
3. Each integration card displays:
   - Integration name
   - Credential type (Cloud Credentials or Local Config)
   - Number of sites using the integration
4. Click on any integration card to manage its settings

### What if I don't see any integrations?

If no integrations appear, your organization hasn't been set up with any data transfer integrations yet. Contact support at [contact@aitriumos.com](mailto:contact@aitriumos.com) to request integration setup.

## Credential Groups

Credential Groups allow you to manage different sets of credentials and user permissions within the same integration. This is useful when:

- Different sites require different credentials
- Different teams need access to different systems
- You want to segregate access for security or organizational reasons

<img src="/images/integrations/integration_details_page_credential_groups.png" alt="Integration details page showing credential groups" style={{borderRadius: '8px'}} />

### Key Features

- **Multiple Groups**: Create multiple credential groups per integration
- **Site Assignment**: Assign specific sites to each credential group
- **User Permissions**: Control which users have access to each group
- **Independent Credentials**: Each group can have different credential values

### Creating a Credential Group

1. Open an integration from the main Integrations page
2. Navigate to the **Credential Groups** tab
3. Click **Create New Group** in the left sidebar
4. Provide:
   - **Group Name**: A descriptive name for the credential group
   - **Site Selection**: Choose which sites will use these credentials
5. Click **Create** to save the new group

### Editing a Credential Group

1. Select the credential group from the left sidebar
2. Click the **Edit** button (pencil icon)
3. Update the group name or site assignments
4. Click **Save** to apply changes

### Deleting a Credential Group

1. Select the credential group to delete
2. Click the **Delete** button (trash icon)
3. Confirm the deletion in the dialog

**Note**: You must have at least one credential group per integration. The last group cannot be deleted.

## Managing Credentials

### Viewing Current Credentials

1. Open an integration and navigate to **Credential Groups**
2. Select a credential group from the left sidebar
3. The credential form will display all available fields
4. Secret fields (passwords) are masked for security

### Updating Credentials

1. Select a credential group
2. Modify the credential fields as needed:
   - **Text fields**: Enter alphanumeric values
   - **Number fields**: Enter numeric values only
   - **Boolean fields**: Toggle switches on/off
   - **Secret fields**: Enter passwords (will be masked)
3. Click **Update Credentials** to save changes
4. Click **Reset** to discard unsaved changes

### Publishing Credentials

When you update credentials:
- Changes are automatically published to all users in the credential group
- Users across all assigned sites receive the updated credentials
- The system tracks all credential updates in the activity log

**Important**: Credential updates affect all users with access to the credential group. Ensure credentials are correct before publishing.

---

## Managing User Access

### Understanding User Permissions

Users must be granted explicit permission to access integration credentials. Permissions are managed at the credential group level, allowing fine-grained access control.

### Viewing Current Users

1. Select a credential group
2. Navigate to the **Users** tab
3. View the list of users with access to this credential group
4. Use filters to:
   - Search by name or email
   - Filter by site

### Adding Users

1. Navigate to the **Users** tab within a credential group
2. Click **Add Users**
3. Select the site that you wish to permission users from.
4. Select users from the list:
   - Use the search bar to find specific users
   - Filter by site or organization
   - Select multiple users at once
5. Click **Add Users**
6. The system automatically:
   - Grants access to the credential group
   - Publishes credentials to the new users
   - Records the action in the activity log

<img src="/images/integrations/add_user_integration.png" alt="Add users dialog for permissioning users to an integration" style={{borderRadius: '8px'}} />

**Note**: Only active users in your Aitrium Network are available for selection. Users who already have access are not shown in the list.

### Removing User Access

1. Navigate to the **Users** tab
2. Find the user you want to remove
3. Click the **Remove** button next to their name
4. Confirm the removal in the dialog
5. The user immediately loses access to the integration credentials

**Warning**: Removing access cannot be undone. The user will need to be re-added if you change your mind.

## Integration Logs

The Integration Logs tab provides technical execution logs showing when the integration has run and whether it succeeded or failed. This is useful for debugging integration issues.

### Viewing Integration Logs

1. Open an integration
2. Navigate to the **Logs** tab
3. View chronological list of integration executions

<img src="/images/integrations/integration_logs.png" alt="Integration logs showing execution history and status" style={{borderRadius: '8px'}} />

### Information Tracked

- **Execution Status**: Success or failure of each integration run
- **Timestamps**: When each execution occurred
- **Error Messages**: Technical details when executions fail
- **Execution Details**: Information about what was processed

### Using Integration Logs for Troubleshooting

- Identify when an integration last ran successfully
- Diagnose technical failures or connection issues
- Monitor integration performance and reliability
- Debug data transfer problems

---

## Audit Logs

Configuration changes to integrations (credential updates, user access changes, credential group modifications) are tracked in the **Audit Logs** page, which is separate from the integration-specific logs.

### Accessing Audit Logs

Navigate to the **Audit Logs** page from the main dashboard to view:
- Credential updates and who made them
- User access changes (additions and removals)
- Credential group creation, updates, and deletion
- Affected resources (sites and users impacted by each change)
- Timestamps for all configuration changes

This provides a complete audit trail for compliance and security purposes.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Can't See Any Integrations

**Solution**: Your organization may not have integrations configured. Contact support at [contact@aitriumos.com](mailto:contact@aitriumos.com) to set up integrations.

### Problem: Can't Update Credentials

**Possible Causes**:
- Required fields are missing
- Invalid values entered (e.g., text in a number field)
- Insufficient permissions

**Solution**: Check that all required fields are filled and valid. Ensure you have administrator permissions.

### Problem: User Not Appearing in Add Users List

**Possible Causes**:
- User already has access to the credential group
- User is inactive
- User belongs to a site not in your network

**Solution**: Verify the user's status and check if they already have access.

### Problem: Credential Updates Not Taking Effect

**Solution**:
- Verify the update was successful in the **Audit Logs** page
- Ensure users are assigned to the correct credential group
- Contact support if the issue persists

### Problem: Integration Execution Failures

**Solution**:
- Check the **Logs** tab on the integration detail page for error messages
- Review recent credential changes in **Audit Logs** that might have caused issues
- Verify network connectivity to the integration endpoint
- Contact support with the error details from the Integration Logs

## Security Best Practices

1. **Limit Access**: Only grant integration access to users who need it
2. **Regular Audits**: Periodically review user access in each credential group
3. **Credential Rotation**: Regularly update integration credentials
4. **Monitor Audit Logs**: Review the Audit Logs page for unusual configuration changes
5. **Monitor Integration Logs**: Check integration execution logs for unexpected failures or patterns
6. **Immediate Revocation**: Remove access immediately when users leave or change roles
7. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Use credential groups to ensure users only access what they need
